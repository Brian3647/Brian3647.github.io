# **Contributing :beers:**

_Refer to [here](./PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) and [here](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE/) for issue and PR templates respectively_

This web uses my own "framework" [encoped](https://github.com/Brian3647/encoped). It's extremely easy to use, but you'll need to install it.

## **Commit format**

It's recommended to use [gitmoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji-cli) for your commits.
