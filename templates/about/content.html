		I usually define myself as a calm programmer residing in Mollet del Vall√®s,
		Barcelona. I love music
		<i
			>(right now, especially Arctic Monkeys, AJR, and some other indie
			singers)</i
		>
		and I don't seek much more than building whatever my not-so-creative mind
		comes up with. I like cats, debates, and gossip. My birthday is on the 23rd
		of June.
